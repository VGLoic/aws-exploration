# Deploy a Web server to AWS

The goal of this repository is to implement a trivial web server, deploy it on AWS and describe the process along the way.

## Service description

This is a simple webserver exposing one healthcheck route `GET /health`. The associated handler will check the health of a connected `postgres` database and answer a status `200` response with a JSON body `{ ok: true, services: { database: true } }`.

## Steps

Here is the list of steps that have been taken when developing and deploying the services.

### 1. First iteration of the service

The web server is developed with basic capabilities:
- `GET /health` route which answers a status `200` and JSON data `{ ok: true }`,
- global timeout controlled by env var `GLOBAL_TIMEOUT`,
- server listening on port controlled by env var `PORT` (default to `3000`),
- graceful shutdown.

At this stage `PORT=3002 cargo run` should start the server and `curl http://localhost:3002/health` should give back a 200 status response with `{ ok: true }` as body.

### 2. Setup Dockerfile

I am not the biggest Docker expert so I went checking online on how to create a proper `Dockefile` for a rust-based webserver, I ended up on the [Rust language guide by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/language/rust/build-images/). I did not know that `Docker` exposes now a `docker init` script in order to setup the all things Docker. So I went with it
```console
docker init
```
I used all the default options and it created a `.dockerignore`, a `compose.yml`, a `Dockerfile` and a `README.Docker.md`. All the files contain explanatory comments wich is greatly appreciated.

During the creation process of the Dockerfile, I set that the listening port was `3000` and as a consequence, the `EXPOSE 3000` command has been added in the Dockerfile. **However**, I don't really know in advance which `port` I will use since I setup the exposed `port` in my service as controlled by the `PORT` env variable. The `EXPOSE` cmd is actually not publishing and acts as a documentation between the Dockerfile and the developer running it, as [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) explains. Therefore, I remove the `EXPOSE 3000` line in my Dockerfile and I will handle the exposed `PORT` when running my container.

I modify the `compose.yml` as an example of it
``` yaml
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final
    ports:
      - 3002:3001
    environment:
      - PORT=3001
```
My `PORT` env variable is set to 3001, so the container will listen on PORT 3001, and I map the container port to the "public" (outside of `Docker`) PORT 3002. See more about ports in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/#published-ports).

At this stage, I can run the docker compose
```console
docker compose up
```
and query my healthcheck route on PORT 3002
```console
curl http://localhost:3002
```

## Development

This repository uses the [rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), make sure to have it installed before going further. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

In order to install dependencies and verify that everything is fine, start by building the project
```console
cargo build
```

Start the server
```console
cargo run
```
